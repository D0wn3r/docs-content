<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created](/containers/kubernetes/how-to/create-cluster/) a Kubernetes cluster running on Scaleway Instances (v1.21+)
  - You have a Scaleway Project or Organization ID, [Access and Secret key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)
</Message>

The Scaleway Block Volume CSI driver is designed to manage Scaleway Block Volumes through container orchestration systems like Kubernetes. It comes pre-installed on Kubernetes Kapsule and Kosmos clusters. You can find this plugin in the pods under the `kube-system' namespace.

To check if it is running correctly, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get csidriver
```

The output of the command above gives you a quick status update on the CSI plugin in your Kubernetes cluster. The latest [release 0.3](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-csi/tree/release-0.3#block-storage-low-latency) of the Scaleway CSI supports Block Storage Low Latency volumes. 

If you are curious about the CSI release version you re currently using, head over to the your [Cockpit interface](/observability/cockpit/how-to/access-grafana-and-managed-dashboards/). 
Go to the **Kubernetes Cluster - Overview** dashboard, to find the specific CSI release number running on your cluster.

<Message type="note">
	* Starting from February 2024, Block Volumes and Snapshots will be managed using the [Scaleway Block Storage API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/). This change is designed to improve efficiency and keep up with the latest industry standards.
	* Your Block Volumes will display in the [Block Storage](https://console.scaleway.com/block-storage/volumes) section of the Scaleway console.
	* The **boot on block** feature for low latency Block Storage volumes is expetecte in Q2

## Upgrading the CSI to version 0.3

1. Add the following tag to your cluster to enable the migration process:
   ```bash
   enable-csi-v0.3=migrate
   ```
2. Once the cluster tag is updated, the cluster will transition to the _updating_ status. This indicates that the new CSI v0.3 is being deployed on your nodes.

   <Message type="important">
   		Once the migration to CSI v0.3 is initiated, it is impossible to rollback to CSI v0.2. Ensure that all prerequisites and compatibility checks are thoroughly performed before proceeding.
   </Message>

<Message type="note"
   Note that this migration method specifically applies to PVCs (Persistent Volume Claims) and Snapshots. System volumes will remain on the Instances side and will not be affected by this migration.
</Message>

3. Once the migration process is completed, verify the successful movement of PVCs and Snapshots to the SBS-API. Check for any errors or warnings in the logs and resolve them if necessary.

4. Perform any additional post-migration steps or configurations required for your specific environment or applications.
